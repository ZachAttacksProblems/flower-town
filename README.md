# Welcome to flower-town

A github repository for my passion project for practicing some 
coding, math and problem solving. All to solve a fun problem 
in a charming video game: breeding blue roses in Animal Crossing: 
New Horizons. 

My goal here is to have some fun and see if we can find some strategies 
for breeding the hard to get blue rose in-game using reinforcement learning. 
What will be neat is if we recover some of the strategies already 
discovered by other's (see below) and if we can maybe find a some faster 
paths to success. 

## Acknowlegments/References

Unsuprisingly, there are some people who have already done some excellent 
work and come up with excellent guides on the subject. Some guides/sources 
I found particulary helpful were:
- Aeter's In-depth game-guides (https://aiterusawato.github.io/satogu/acnh/flowers/)
- Yue's acnh guide (https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/bluerose.html)
- Aeon's (and contributors) Flower Breeding Simulator (https://gardenscience.ac/)
- cestislife's visual guides (https://cestislife.github.io/)
- the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTdwUI4iZE1wdfZv1xdi2qJtldnWS2iiQdjRjKP-4oKoH0R8a07vaVFxZHSwFiDlwzb6gZAE8U5C_vG/pubhtml#) with the datamined FgFlowerHeredity table

## Current State
This is a work in progress and is mostly just for myself. Currently the 
repository needs to be cleaned up after comitting the work that was done
purely in a local folder on my desktop.
