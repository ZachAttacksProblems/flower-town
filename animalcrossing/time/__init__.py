"""
Most modules in this folder are under construction or 
were used to test some math or to evaluate slow/difficult 
computations. 

Many are also have __main__ declarations which are 
not properly written to be called as a module script
i.e. python -m animalcrossing.time.XXX may not work properly 
and they may be written to be called as 'normal' scripts i.e. 
by invoking python XXX from the terminal in the time folder.
